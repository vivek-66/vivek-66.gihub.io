                        Manga is a style of Japanese comic books and graphic novels. It is a popular form of entertainment in Japan and has gained worldwide recognition and popularity. Manga covers a wide range of genres and target audiences, including action, adventure, romance, fantasy, science fiction, horror, and more.

                        The art style of manga typically features black-and-white illustrations, although colored versions of popular series are sometimes produced. Manga is read from right to left, top to bottom, which is the traditional Japanese reading order. This can be different from the standard left-to-right reading direction in many Western countries.

                        Manga is not limited to any specific age group and caters to readers of all ages. There are manga series targeted at children, teenagers, and adults. Some manga series have become incredibly successful and have had a significant impact on popular culture worldwide.

                        In addition to manga, there are anime adaptations, which are animated versions of manga series, often produced for television or the big screen. The close relationship between manga and anime allows fans to experience their favorite stories in both written and animated formats.
